# Blog-API
This is a full-stack blog application built with Express and MongoDB. It features a RESTful API for managing blog posts and comments, along with authentication using JWT. The app includes separate front-end interfaces for public users to view posts and for admins to create, edit, publish/unpublish posts, and manage comments.
